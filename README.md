## Traditional 

These competitions require you to exercise algorithmic and data structure knowlegde.

* [Google Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam/) - You will have a few hours to solve increasingly hard algorithmic programming problems. Top coders will be invited to the on-site finals at Google. Starts in March.
* [USACO](http://usaco.org) - Strictly for high schoolers, this algorithmic competition identifies talent for the US IOI team. Runs from December to March. 
* [Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/) - Online computer programming competitions in the Java, C++, and C# languages. Competitions take place twice a week, and members can win from $25-$300.
* [Coderbyte](https://www.coderbyte.com/) - A website that helps you practice your programming skills with a collection of interview questions, videos, and solutions.
* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) - A series of 600+ mathematical/computer programming problems. 

## Games 

In these competitions, you will write a bot to play a game.

* [Halite](https://halite.io) -  Using the programming language of your choice, right a bot to fight for control of a 2D grid. Victory will require braving a branching factor billions of times higher than that of Go. Hosted by [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/). Ends in February.
* [Battlecode](https://www.battlecode.org/) - Program a bot to play a new real-time strategy game every January. Hosted by MIT. Java and other JVM languages are supported.
